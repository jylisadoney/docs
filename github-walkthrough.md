# GitHub Quick Workflow Guide:
## Cloning, Fetching, Pulling, Editing, and Pushing

### Step 1: 
Go to www.github.com and locate the repository you want to interact with.  

### Step 2:
Click the green “clone or download” drop down.

### Step 4: 
Your GitHub Desktop application should automatically open with the below prompt. Click “Clone” in the window that appears.

### Step 5: 
This will save a version of the repository locally on your computer. Though it’s unlikely any collaborators have edited the repository since you cloned it moments ago,  you’ll want to click “Fetch origin” – it’s good muscle memory to build, because...

### Step 5 (cont.): 
...you’ll always want to be working with the most up-to-date version of the repository (so as to avoid complicated merge issues). When you see this, you’ll want to “Pull origin” before moving on.

### Step 6: 
Once you’re all up to date, open your preferred code editing application (the one shown below is Visual Studio Code). Go to File > Open, and locate/select your repository’s folder – you’ll want to open the entire folder in your code editor.

### Step 7: 
In your code editor, locate the file you want to edit and open it.

### Step 8: 
Make your changes, and save the file.

### Step 9: 
Back in your GitHub Desktop application, you’ll see that your changes have been recorded (with old content in red and new in green). Now is when you’ll write description of your changes and “commit” (i.e. save) them to the main branch.

### Step 10: 
Finally, “push” your changes back up to the master branch so that the actual GitHub Repository will contain them.
